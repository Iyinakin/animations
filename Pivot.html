    <h1>PIVOT ANIMATOR</h1>
    <img src="Images/Pivot_logo.png">
    <p>Pivot animator is a desktop animator used for making animations. there are different general versions of Pivot animator. They are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>version 2</li>
        <li>version 3</li>
        <li>version 4</li>
        <li><b>PIVOT ANIMATOR v5</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The animator I am presently using is 'v5'. It is the only version that can have multi-colored stickfigures. The rest only have black and white figures, which you can edit to give different colors in v5 or give one color in the animation. There is a way to link sticknodes and pivot together(i.e. using pivot stickfigures in sticknodes), for this, verion 2 stickfigures will be needed. They are the only stickfigures that can be used in sticknodes (both sticknodes and sticknodes pro).</p>
    <p>There are two items (that I know of) that you can use to make animations in Pivot v5. Thy are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Colorful stickfigures</li>
        <li>Sprites (images that you can link together to make a stickfigure)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To learn more about pivot, go to <a href="www.pivotanimator.net" title="Go to the pivot website">the pivot website</a>. Here you can get new stickfigures from their stk library, get information about the different versions available for download and so on.</p>
